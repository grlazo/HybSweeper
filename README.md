A software tool was developed to handle images of high-density gridding patterns which 
were matched to clones housed in microtiter dishes. As high-throughput methodologies 
contribute to large archives of stored clone resources, methods need to be available for 
convenient processing of hybridization information for the retrieval of the clones needed 
for research endeavors. A Java software package, Hybsweeper, was developed to select 
clone identities from autoradiographs which were generated through simple probing methods, 
overgo probe hybridizations, and isolation of unique clones from saturation hybridization. 
The software runs on a wide range of computer operating systems and the program source may 
be obtained from to allow for custom modifications if needed.

Figure 1. View of the Hybsweeper workspace.

Shown are selected spots within two of the six gridding areas (the middle two gridding areas). 
All highlighted spots are recorded, while one is pending in the bottom grid (a spot with a 
1-1 paired position selected). For comparison, no spots were selected in the four neighboring 
gridding areas to the right and left. Each of the smaller squares represents the 4 Ã— 4 offset 
area for a well location where 16 possible spots are represented. To the left of the grid areas 
is an information console showing the selected image.gif image, the Pick Spot mode of selection 
is in progress, coordinates of pending spot number 54 (at X 127:Y 111), graphical orientation 
of the selected pending spot (1,1) and the one spot selected, options for spot rating 
(not selected), and report options (Plate Order) with report viewable in the display box below it. 
Image scrollbars are also viewable, since the entire image is not within the display area 
(only a portion of the bottom three gridding areas is viewable).

Note: Using the above display is much better than using the alternative sweeper program.
